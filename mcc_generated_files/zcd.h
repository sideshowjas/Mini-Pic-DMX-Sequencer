  @Summary
    This is the generated driver implementation file for the ZCD driver using MPLAB® Code Configurator

  @Description
    This header file provides implementations for driver APIs for ZCD.
    Generation Information :
        Product Revision  :  MPLAB® Code Configurator - v2.25
        Device            :  PIC16F1708
        Driver Version    :  2.00
    The generated drivers are tested against the following:
        Compiler          :  XC8 v1.34
        MPLAB             :  MPLAB X v2.35 or v3.00

        This routine initializes the ZCD_Initialize.

        This routine should only be called once during system initialization.

        Determines if current is sinking or sourcing

      @Description
        This routine is used to determine if current is sinking or sourcing
        depending on output polarity.

        For non inverted polarity:
        high - Indicates current is sinking
        low - Indicates current is sourcing

        For inverted polarity:
        high - Indicates current is sourcing
        low - Indicates current is sinking

      @Preconditions
        ZCD_Initialize() function should have been called before calling this function.

      @Param
        None

      @Returns
       high or low

      @Example
        <code>
        ZCD_Initialize();

        {
